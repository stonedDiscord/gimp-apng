APNG Plug-In for GIMP
=====================

This package is Animated PNG (APNG) plug-in for GIMP 2.x.

APNG plug-in provides Animated PNG (APNG) image file load and save modules
for the GIMP. This plug-in works both APNG and PNG.


Quick build notes
=================

You need to have installed *patched* libpng.
Libpng can be downloaded from
	http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/

And you can get APNG patch from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng-apng/

Also you need to have installed GIMP version 2.4 or newer (2.6 or newer is
recommended) and GTK+ version 2.12 or newer.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.


Information
===========

If an image has multiple layers and "As animation" is checked in save dialog,
the image is saved as APNG. Otherwise the image is saved as PNG.

Note, APNG-files usually have the filename-suffix ".png", the MIME type
"image/png" and same signature/magic number as PNG is handled by PNG plug-in
in the GIMP.
