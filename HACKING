If you want to hack on the APNG plug-in package, it will make you life easier
to have the following packages (or newer versions) installed:

	- GNU autoconf >= 2.54
	- GNU automake >= 1.9
	- intltool >= 0.40

These are only the additional requirements if you want to compile from
the git repository.
